## Wow.MD
Wow. I didn't know I could do this.  But it all worked.

### What I Did to create this repo

  1. I create a local repo.  Added some files to it. 
  1. I created a blank repo on github.  (Without a single file.)
  1. Copied the URL from the Github blank repo and setup the local remote.
  1. Then I pushed the local repo to GitHub.
  1. It successfull pushed upsteam.
  1. Now I am creating this file on github and intend to pull it from local.

  Lets see if I can pull this down.  But first create a pull request for Wow.md.
